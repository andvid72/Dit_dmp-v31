README: Denoising Model Patching via Mixture-of-Prompts
Project Description
This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of the Denoising Model Patching (DMP) technique using Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP). DMP is a novel approach to improving the performance of language models by patching them with carefully crafted prompts. MoP allows for a more diverse and effective set of prompts to be used for patching.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
